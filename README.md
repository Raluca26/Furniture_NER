I developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract furniture product names from URLs efficiently. Using Scrapy, I initiated a project and created a spider in order to scrape URLs and parse their content. After cleaning and annotating the data, I split it into train and test sets and configured the NER model using Hugging Face's transformers library. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted, and the best model was saved. Finally, I concatenated the train and predicted data, visualized the results, and created a comprehensive documentation.

The detailed documentation can be found in the pdf file "Project_Documentation". The list with all urls and products for each are in ./data/full_list_products
