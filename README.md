I developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract furniture product names from URLs efficiently. Using Scrapy, I initiated a project and created a spider in order to scrape URLs and parse their content. After cleaning and annotating the data, I split it into train and test sets and configured the NER model using Hugging Face's transformers library. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted, and the best model was saved and used for predictions. Finally I have created a csv with the urls and the associated present products for each, and I have done some data visualization.

The detailed documentation can be found in the pdf file "Project_Documentation". The csv list with all urls and products for each is in ./data/full_list_products
